# REad and Clean DADTa
```{r}
catch_original <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.302.1", method = "libcurl"),
                          stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(catch_original)
```
Remove `all` column and `notes` column becaues we don't need them.

```{r}
catch_data <- catch_original %>% 
  # select (Region, Year, Chinook, Sockeye, Coho, Pink, Chum)
  select(-All, -notesRegCode) #this way tells what columns to get rid of

summary(catch_data)
```
## Fix Chinook Column

Use`mutate` to fix Chinook column

```{r}
catch_clean <- catch_data %>%
  mutate(Chinook = ifelse(Chinook == "I", 1, Chinook)) %>%
  mutate(Chinook = as.numeric(Chinook))
  
```
Finding the rows that got turned into NA

```{r}
i <- which(is.na(catch_clean$Chinook))
i
```
```{r}
catch_original[i, ]
```


# Reshape Data

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_clean %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(Region, Year),
  names_to = "species",
  values_to = "count")
head(catch_long)
```

```{r}
catch_wide <- catch_long %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Year,
              values_from = count)
head(catch_wide)
```

`rename` count column to `catch_thousands`
```{r}
catch_long <- catch_long %>%
  rename(catch_thousands = count) 
```

```{r}
catch_long <- catch_long %>%
    mutate(catch = catch_thousands * 1000) %>%
  select(-catch_thousands)
head(catch_long)
```




# Summarize Data
```{r}
mean_region <- catch_long %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(catch_mean = mean(catch),
            num_obs = n())
mean_region
```

Calculate total catch per species
What is the most commonly caught species?

```{r}
total_species <- catch_long %>%
  
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(catch)) %>%
    arrange(desc(total))

total_species
```

```{r}
total_species_pre_1900 <- catch_long %>%
  filter(Year < 1900) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(catch)) %>%
    arrange(desc(total))
total_species_pre_1900
```


#Joins to region table

```{r}
region_defs <- read.csv(url("https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v2/object/df35b.303.1",
                            method = "libcurl"),
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
 select(code, mgmtArea)
   

head(region_defs)
``````{r}
catch_joined <- left_join(catch_long, region_defs, by = c("Region" = "code"))
head(catch_joined)
```
# Separate and Unite

```{r}
site_codes <- data.frame(site =c("Haw-100",
                                 "Haw-101",
                                 "OAH-102",
                                 "OAH-103",
                                 "MAI-100"),
                         stringsAsFactors = F)
```
separate island and site number using `separate`

```{r}
site_codes_split <- site_codes %>%
  separate(site, into = c("islands", "site_num"), sep = "-", remove = F)
site_codes_split
```

```{r}
united <- site_codes_split %>% 
  unite(col = site_code, islands, site_num, sep = "_")
united
```
